packages and modules
to make your own package create a folder with package name and inside that create go files with package name same as folder name
then you can import that package in other files using import "package/name"
also names of functions and variables that start with uppercase letter are exported and can be accessed from other packages
while names that start with lowercase letter are unexported and can only be accessed within the same package
